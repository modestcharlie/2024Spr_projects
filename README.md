## Introduction
Hi there, welcome to my project github page. This project is a Type III project and aims to explore the relationship 
between the occurrences of bigfoot and related factors from the state-level and
county-level analysis.
By analyzing the state and county data from different perspectives like poverty level, 
population, educational level, and unemployment rate, 
I will try to find some interesting findings and relationship between them
and the occurrences of bigfoot. 

## Data Resource

1.Bigfoot data: https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data

2.Poverty data: https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PovertyEstimates.xlsx?v=8075.7

3.Population data: https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17827

4.Educational Level data: https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/Education.xlsx?v=8075.7

5.Unemployment rate data: https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/Unemployment.xlsx?v=8075.7

## Hypothesis
1.There is a clear relationship between the number of bigfoot sightings and poverty rate and population.

2.There is a clear relationship between the number of bigfoot sightings and population.

3.There is a clear relationship between the number of bigfoot sightings and educational level(the proportion of population completing college-level education.

4.There is a clear relationship between the number of bigfoot sightings and unemployment rate
